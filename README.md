# Crisis in Numbers: COVID-19 Data Analysis Project


## Introduction

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The project explores various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries and data manipulation techniques.

## Dataset

The COVID-19 dataset used in this analysis is provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). It includes data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics from various locations around the world.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project includes:

- Data exploration and analysis using SQL queries.
- Calculation of key COVID-19 statistics, including cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- Demonstration of SQL skills, including joins, CTEs, window functions, and more.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates proficiency in the following SQL skills and techniques:

- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- Temporary Tables
- Aggregate Functions
- View Creation
- Data Type Conversion

## Queries and Analysis

The project comprises several SQL queries and analyses, including:

- Total cases and deaths by location and over time.
- Likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in specific locations.
- Percentage of population infected with COVID-19.
- Identification of countries with high infection rates relative to population.
- Analysis of death counts and rates by location and continent.
- Global COVID-19 trends and statistics.
